  <small>What this extension does with your private data</small>
  <ul class="bullets">
    <li>
       It 
      <strong>DOES</strong>
       send hostname of 
      <i>almost</i>
       every website you're visiting to an external website (called "
      <i>source</i>
      ", in options you can choose which one, default is ipinfodb.com) to get its location information when you're visiting it for a first time.
    </li>
    <li>
       It 
      <strong>DOES</strong>
       save list of hostnames for all sites you've ever visited together with their location information and first visit time (feature called "
      <i>cache</i>
      ") for about one month.
    </li>
    <li>
       It does 
      <strong>NOT</strong>
       request source on 
      <i>every</i>
       site visit or page load (since information gets retrieved from cache).
    </li>
    <li>
       It does 
      <strong>NOT</strong>
       request 
      <i>source</i>
       or store in 
      <i>cache</i>
       information about most popular websites, because information about them is already stored in extension itself (feature called "
      <i>precache</i>
      ")
    </li>
    <li>
       It 
      <strong>DOES</strong>
       ask Opera to use "
      <i>custom flags</i>
      ", if you set any, every time you switch to or open a page of a site from related country. If it is cached or not is decided by Opera and is out of control of this extension.
    </li>
    <li>
       It does 
      <strong>NOT</strong>
       send any data related to your browsing history to anyone apart from explained above (to 
      <i>source</i>
       or 
      <i>custom flags</i>
      ) and in separate section below (for 
      <i>statistics</i>
      , if you enable it)
    </li>
    <li> It uses unencrypted connections, meaning anyone with sufficient knowledge around you can "sniff" and copy or even modify all communicated data.</li>
    <li> On each page it sets javascript object window['flag-button'] so other scripts and extensions could benefit from knowing location information.</li>
    <li> Opera browser periodically checks for extension updates -- it is expected behaviour and you should be aware of it.</li>
    <li> Any extension behaviour outside of features discussed here is a bug (either of extension or this privacy policy) and should be immediately reported to the developer.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Privacy policy concerning usage statistics</h4>
  <ul class="bullets">
    <li> Participation in statistics collection is purely optional, off by default and no other functions of this extension depend on it</li>
    <li> Usage statistics is designed to be as anonymous as possible -- no personal information is stored and no attempt is made to link separate pieces of data to each other or to individual users</li>
    <li> Description of data that will be sent is available in relevant section in settings. In same place you can review the data you're sending and stop participating in sending statistics</li>
    <li>
       Extension does 
      <strong>NOT</strong>
       send individual hostnames or visiting times -- only "total numbers" are sent
    </li>
    <li>
       Extension does 
      <strong>NOT</strong>
       send preferences which may contain your private data
    </li>
    <li>
       You 
      <strong>CAN NOT</strong>
       change how often you send data, because statistics are based on assumption that everyone sends data with same frequency
    </li>
    <li>
       You 
      <strong>CAN NOT</strong>
       change the data itself, because it will undermine my belief in it
    </li>
    <li>
       Statistics server 
      <strong>DOES</strong>
       record current time, your IP and User-Agent string of your browser when you submit data - this is a standard feature of all websites. This information will 
      <strong>NOT</strong>
       be used to identify you.
    </li>
  </ul>
