Have you ever wondered where in the "real" world is located the site, which you're currently viewing? Norway? USA? Netherlands? This extension gives an answer to this question!
It adds a button, on which you see a flag of a country, where the site is located, and two letters, denoting this country. If you hover the button with your mouse, a tooltip will appear, where you can learn server's IP and the full country name. If you click the button, a bigger window will popup, with more detailed information: Region, City, and geographical coordinates (if available). The same window features links to who.is (domain information site) and maps showing approximate location of the website.
This extension brings some of the functionality provided by the Flagfox extension for Firefox to Opera.
Privacy note: After installation of this extension, when you visit a site for the first time, its name is sent to an external webservice (ipinfodb.com by default) in order to look up information about it. While this extension is NOT designed to spy on you, external webservice might store list of websites you are visiting. More information can be found in privacy policy on the extension support page.
