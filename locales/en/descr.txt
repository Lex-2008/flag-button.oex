Have you ever wondered where in the "real" world is located the site, which you're currently viewing? Norway? USA? Netherlands? This extension gives an answer to this question!
It adds a button, on which you see a flag of a country, where the site is located, and two letters, denoting this country. If you hover the button with your mouse, a tooltip will appear, where you can learn server's IP and the full country name. If you click the button, a bigger window will popup, with more detailed information: Region, City, and geographical coordinates (if available). The same window features links to who.is (domain information site) and google maps.
